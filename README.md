I'm Abdul Haseeb. I'm doing Bs Software Engineering from Sindh Madressa-tul-Islam University, City Campus, Karachi. It's my third year at University (6th Semester).<br>

My academic background in software engineering has provided me with a strong foundation in relevant skills and knowledge, even if I haven't had the opportunity to apply them in a professional setting. <br>

As part of my ongoing commitment to advancing my skills in Mobile App development, I have recently enrolled in "Flutter App Development course" at "Saylani Mass IT Training". I am looking forward to learning about Flutter and applying it to real-world projects.
